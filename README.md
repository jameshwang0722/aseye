# Aseye | Carbon Emission Tracker/Predictor Data Engineering Project

## Introduction

Aseye's goal is to create a software data platform that analyzes carbon emissions generated by facilities in the USA. It automates extracting data from the EPA, storing it in GCP, creating and applying a prediction model of the carbon emission for each facility, and updating the dashboard autonomously.

## Pipeline 
<img src="images/flowchart.jpg">
1. Retrieve emissions and facility data from EPA <br> 
2. Store raw data in Google Cloud Storage <br> 
3. Extract raw data and transform it using Mage-AI <br> 
4. Create a prediction model using transformed data from the step above <br> 
5. Store data in Google BigQuery <br> 
6. Create data visualization using Google Looker Studio


## Dataset Sources
The dataset can be retrieved using the EPA API: https://www.epa.gov/

<br> 
Note: <br> 
- Historical data: Jan 2012 - Dec 2021 <br> 
- Prediction: Jan 2022 - Dec 2022 <br> 
- Only added 3 states (AL, CA, FL) due to the large dataset. Waiting for Mage to increase capacity of extraction
